Jarvis is a Python-based voice assistant with a custom GUI built using CustomTkinter. It utilizes speech recognition and text-to-speech technology to interact with users in real-time. Upon recognizing the wake word "Jarvis", it can execute a variety of voice commands such as opening websites (Google, YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.), playing specific songs from a predefined library, and gracefully exiting on request. The assistant runs in a background thread and displays live interaction logs in the GUI, offering a responsive and interactive user experience.
